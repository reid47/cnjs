# CSS-in-JS benchmarks

some benchmark tests that compare the performance of `cnjs` to various other CSS-in-JS libraries:
- `cxs`
- `emotion`
- `fela`
- `glamorous`
- `inline-styles`
- `styled-components`

## Acknowledgements

The initial set of tests was borrowed from jxnblk's benchmarks [here](https://github.com/jxnblk/cxs/tree/master/benchmarks).
